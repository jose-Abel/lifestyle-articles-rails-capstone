# Life Style Articles Rails Capstone

The Microverse Rails Capstone that consist of building a web app based on lifestyle articles website. Following the design of the website https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version, and personalising the content.

Following an MVP approach per Rails structure, the project consist of the models, views and controllers of each resource and the routes file routing the propers HTML request to it's corresponding route.

The project has 4 resources as instructed in the requirements. This are User, Article, Vote, Category. A User has many articles and many votes. An Article belongs to an User and has many votes. A Vote belongs to an Article and to an User. And the Article and Category have a many to many relationship through the article categories table.

The main view is the Article Index view since its the root page. This view is in charge of rendering the article with the most votes in the hero section and the rest of the articles below. In order to implement this, a scope was created in the Vote model to query for the article with the most votes and helper methods were created in the article helpers file to remove the logic from the views to a helper file.

The articles in the root page have a link to the category they belong to, once click it redirect to the category show view where all the articles from the same category are display.

Also, the articles in the root page has a link in the title of the article that redirects to the article show page where the complete body of the article is display and if the current user login is the author of the article will display buttons to edit the article and to delete it.

The web app has a login and sign up system that only requires a username as requested in the instructions of the project.

For the CSS it was used Boostrap and also some CSS code directly in the custom.css.scss file.

To upload image was implemented with the gems carrierwave, minimagick and fog-aws. 

The test were made with Rails minitest library.
